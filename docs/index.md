| Endpoint             | `endpoint_name`    | `terraform import saviynt_endpoint_resource.example ENDPOINT1`          |
| Connection Resources | `connection_name` | `terraform import saviynt_ad_connection_resource.example AD_CONN1`      |
| Dynamic Attributes   | `endpoint`        | `terraform import saviynt_dynamic_attribute_resource.example ENDPOINT1` |

## Credential Management Best Practices
To ensure secure handling of sensitive credentials, follow these best practices:
1. **Use Vault-backed Secrets**   : Externalize sensitive values using a secure secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault. This avoids hardcoding secrets in .tf files or storing them in Terraform state.
2. **Prefer Environment Variables**   : If Vault integration is not available, use environment variables (e.g., TF_VAR_password) to pass secrets instead of storing them in source files.
3. **Use Ephemeral Resources for Sensitive Data**
   Handle all sensitive data using **ephemeral resources** â€” those created only when needed and destroyed immediately afterward. Avoid long-term storage of secrets in:
   - Terraform state files (`terraform.tfstate`)
   - Version control systems (e.g., Git)
   - Local plaintext configuration files

---

## Feature: Ephemeral File Credential Resource

The **Ephemeral File Credential Resource** is a transient Terraform resource that provides temporary, in-memory credentials to other connector resources by reading values from a local JSON file at apply time. This allows secure and flexible provisioning without persisting sensitive data in the Terraform state.

### Supported Connectors

The following connectors are supported and can consume credentials provided by this resource:

- **AD**: `username`, `password`
- **ADSI**: `username`, `password`
- **DB**: `username`, `password`, `change_pass_json`
- **EntraId**: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `access_token`,`azure_mgmt_access_token`, `windows_connector_json`, `change_pass_json`, `connection_json`
- **Github REST**: `connection_json`, `access_tokens`
- **REST**: `connection_json`, `change_pass_json`
- **Salesforce**: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`
- **SAP**: `password`, `prov_password`
- **Unix**: `username`, `password`, `change_password_json`,  `passphrase`, `ssh_key`, `ssh_pass_through_password`, `ssh_pass_through_sshkey`, `ssh_pass_through_passphrase`
- **Workday**: `username`, `password`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`

### Usage

The ephemeral credential resource reads from a local JSON file structured with the required fields for the target connector. These fields are then dynamically injected into the respective connector resources during the `apply` phase.

> **Note:** This resource is ephemeral and does not store any state. It is designed for use cases where credentials must remain local and transient.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure the credential file is secured and not committed to version control.
- Avoid using this resource in long-lived plans, as it relies on local files that may change or expire.

## Feature: Ephemeral Env Credential Resource

The **Ephemeral Env Credential Resource** is a transient Terraform resource that provides temporary, in-memory credentials to other connector resources by reading values from the environment variables at apply time. This allows secure and flexible provisioning without persisting sensitive data in the Terraform state.

### Supported Connectors

The following connectors are supported and can consume credentials provided by this resource:

- **AD**: `username`, `password`
- **ADSI**: `username`, `password`
- **DB**: `username`, `password`, `change_pass_json`
- **EntraId**: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `access_token`,`azure_mgmt_access_token`, `windows_connector_json`, `change_pass_json`, `connection_json`
- **Github REST**: `connection_json`, `access_tokens`
- **REST**: `connection_json`, `change_pass_json`
- **Salesforce**: `client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`
- **SAP**: `password`, `prov_password`
- **Unix**: `username`, `password`, `change_password_json`,  `passphrase`, `ssh_key`, `ssh_pass_through_password`, `ssh_pass_through_sshkey`, `ssh_pass_through_passphrase`
- **Workday**: `username`, `password`, `client_id`, `client_secret`, `refresh_token`

### Usage

The ephemeral credential resource reads from environment variables. These fields are then dynamically injected into the respective connector resources during the `apply` phase.

> **Note:** This resource is ephemeral and does not store any state. It is designed for use cases where credentials must remain local and transient.


## Feature: `authenticate` Toggle for All Data Source

The Saviynt datasources now have a required boolean flag `authenticate` to control the visibility of sensitive data.

### Purpose

This feature is designed to help prevent potential sensitive data from appearing in Terraform state files or CLI output during `plan` and `apply` when a datasource is called.

### Behavior

- When `authenticate = false`:
  - The provider will **omit** all the attributes from state file.
- When `authenticate = true`:
  - All attributes will be returned as usual with sensitive still not visible.

### Example Usage

```hcl
data "saviynt_rest_connection_datasource" "example" {
  connection_name = "Terraform_REST_Connector"
  authenticate    = false
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide â€“ Breaking Changes, API Errors & Configuration Tips

This section outlines recent changes that may cause issues during Terraform runs and provides guidance on how to resolve them.

### 1. Breaking Change: Removal of connection_type Attribute
The connection_type attribute has been removed from all connector resources.
**Impact**:
If your Terraform configuration includes this attribute, it will now result in an error during `terraform plan` or `apply`.

**Example Error**:
```
â•·
â”‚ Error: Unsupported argument
â”‚
â”‚   on provider.tf line 33, in resource "saviynt_ad_connection_resource" "AD1":
â”‚   33:   connection_type = "AD"
â”‚
â”‚ An argument named "connection_type" is not expected here.
```

**Action Required**:
Manually remove all instances of connection_type from your Terraform resource blocks related to connector resources.

### 2. Security Notice: API Access Restriction Based on SAV Role
If the **Restrict API access based on SAV Role** option is enabled (`Settings > API` in ECM), you might encounter the following error during resource creation:

**Example Error**:
```
â”‚ Error: API Read Failed In Create Block
â”‚
â”‚  with saviynt_endpoint_resource.example,
â”‚  on generated.tf line 5, in resource "saviynt_endpoint_resource" "example":
â”‚   5: resource "saviynt_endpoint_resource" "example" {
â”‚
â”‚ Error: 412 Precondition Failed
```
Recommendation:
Ensure that **Restrict API access based on SAV Role** is disabled for successful provisioning via Terraform.

### 3. API Compatibility Warning: `readlabels` Settings
Changes to the following settings under `Settings > Configuration Files>externalconfig.properties` can affect the structure of API responses:
```properties
users.readlabels=true
endpoints.readlabels=true
entitlements.readlabels=true
roles.readlabels=true
```
**Impact**:
- When these properties are set to `false`, API responses return machine-friendly field names like:
```json
"customproperty10": "Project",
"customproperty12": "Role"
```
- When set to `true` (default and recommended), responses return human-readable keys:
```json
"Custom Property 10": "Project",
"Custom Property 11": "Team"
```

**Recommendation**:
Keep all `readlabels` settings set to `true` to ensure compatibility with Terraform provider expectations and avoid field mapping issues.
