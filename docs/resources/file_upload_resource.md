# saviynt_file_upload_resource (Resource)

File upload resource for uploading files to Saviynt

## Example Usage

```terraform
// Copyright (c) 2025 Saviynt Inc.
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0

resource "saviynt_file_upload_resource" "f" {
  file_path     = "/path/to/users.csv"
  path_location = "Datafiles"

  #Optional
  file_version = "v1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `file_path` (String) Path to the file to upload
- `path_location` (String) Upload location: 'Datafiles' or 'SAV'

### Optional

- `file_version` (String) File version identifier. This acts as a change trigger - increment this value when you need to re-upload the same file with modifications.

### Read-Only

- `error_code` (String) Error code from the upload response
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the file upload
- `message` (String) Response message from the upload

## Security Considerations

- **File Path Validation**: The resource validates file paths to prevent path traversal attacks. Paths containing `../` sequences are rejected.
- **Supported File Types**: Only `.csv` and `.sav` files are supported for upload.
- **File Location Mapping**: 
  - `.csv` files are uploaded to "Datafiles" directory
  - `.sav` files are uploaded to "SAV" directory

## Error Handling

Common errors and solutions:
- `path traversal not allowed`: Remove `../` sequences from file path
- `unsupported file extension`: Use only `.csv` or `.sav` files
- `failed to open file`: Check file exists and has proper permissions

## Best Practices

- Use absolute file paths for reliability
- Ensure files have proper read permissions
- Verify file type matches intended path location
